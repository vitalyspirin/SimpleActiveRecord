# SimpleActiveRecord

Extension of Yii 2 ActiveRecord with automatically generated validators.

## Quick Start and Examples
```php
class T1 extends SimpleActiveRecord
{
    
}
```

There is no need to overload rules() function to specify validators. Validators will be added automatically by 
class constructor based on table schema. However in current version relations (based on foreign keys) will not be added.

There are two ways to create an instance of such class. Constructor of SimpleActiveRecord takes one boolean parameter: 
$maximumValidation. If it's 'false' then only those validators will be added that are generated by Gii. In terms of above 
example it will look like this:

```php
$t1 = new T1(false);
```

If to pass 'true' (which is also default) then maximum validation functionality will be added. It includes ranges for integer, 
ranges for enum, pattern for time etc. Of course you can see those validators:

```php
$t1 = new T1();
var_dump($t1->rules());
```

If table schema changed then validators will be adjusted automatically.

You can also see tests in [SimpleActiveRecordTest.php](tests/unit/SimpleActiveRecordTest.php) for simple examples.
